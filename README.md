  - Engine coolant temperature
  - Seawater intake temperature
  - Seawater output temperature
  - Configurable warning thresholds
- **RPM Monitoring**: Track engine revolutions per minute using digital input counter
- **Signal K Integration**: Seamless integration with Signal K marine data ecosystem
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Wireless data transmission to your Signal K server
- **Web Configuration**: Easy setup through web-based configuration portal
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with configurable read intervals
- **Over-the-Air Updates**: Support for OTA firmware updates

## Hardware Requirements

### Microcontroller
- ESP32 development board (tested with AZ-Delivery DevKit v4)
- Minimum 4MB flash memory

### Circuit Diagram
For detailed wiring information, see the [OneWire Temperature Example](examples/onewire_temperature/README.md).

## Software Requirements

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (recommended) or Arduino IDE
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with PlatformIO extension (recommended)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ihavn1/boat.engine-controller.git
cd boat.engine-controller
```

### 2. Open in PlatformIO

- Open Visual Studio Code
- Install the PlatformIO IDE extension if not already installed
- Open the project folder: `File -> Open Folder` and select the `boat.engine-controller` directory

### 3. Configure Your Hardware

Edit `src/Main.cpp` to match your hardware configuration:

```cpp
// Adjust GPIO pins if needed
static constexpr uint8_t ONEWIRE_PIN = 25;
static constexpr uint8_t RPM_PIN = 16;

// Adjust read intervals (milliseconds)
static constexpr unsigned int RPM_READ_DELAY_MS = 500;
static constexpr unsigned int TEMPERATURE_READ_DELAY_MS = 2000;
```

### 4. Customize Temperature Sensors

Modify the temperature sensor configuration in `src/Main.cpp`:

```cpp
// Example: Coolant temperature with warning thresholds
add_onewire_temp(dts, temperature_read_delay, "coolantTemperature",
         "propulsion.main.coolantTemperature",
         "Coolant Temperature", 110, 120, 130);
```

Parameters:
- `dts`: Dallas Temperature Sensors instance
- `temperature_read_delay`: Read interval in milliseconds
- `"coolantTemperature"`: Local identifier
- `"propulsion.main.coolantTemperature"`: Signal K path
- `"Coolant Temperature"`: Display name
- `110, 120, 130`: Warning threshold values (optional)

### 5. Build and Upload

Using PlatformIO:
1. Connect your ESP32 via USB
2. Click the "Upload" button (→) in the PlatformIO toolbar
3. Or use the command palette: `PlatformIO: Upload`

Using command line:
```bash
pio run --target upload
```

## Configuration

### First-Time Setup

1. After uploading firmware, the device will create a WiFi access point named "Configure SensESP"
2. Connect to this network using your phone or computer
3. A configuration portal should open automatically (or navigate to `192.168.4.1`)
4. Enter your WiFi credentials and Signal K server details
5. Give your device a meaningful hostname (e.g., "EngineMonitor")
6. Click "Save" - the device will reboot and connect to your network

### Signal K Server Authorization

1. The device will automatically discover your Signal K server via mDNS
2. Log in to your Signal K server admin interface
3. Navigate to "Security" -> "Access Requests"
4. Approve the pending request from your device
5. Ensure "Read/Write" permissions are granted

### Sensor Mapping

If using multiple temperature sensors:

1. Navigate to the device's web interface (use its IP address or hostname)
2. Go to the configuration page
3. Identify each sensor by warming it and observing which reading increases
4. Adjust the OneWire addresses in the configuration to match your physical setup

## Signal K Paths

The controller reports data to the following Signal K paths:

### Engine Data
- `propulsion.main.coolantTemperature` - Engine coolant temperature (K)
- `propulsion.main.seaWaterInTemperature` - Seawater intake temperature (K)
- `propulsion.main.seaWaterOutTemperature` - Seawater output temperature (K)
- `propulsion.main.revolutions` - Engine RPM (rev/s)

### System Data
- `sensors.sensesp.systemhz` - System update frequency
- `sensors.sensesp.uptime` - Device uptime
- `sensors.sensesp.freemem` - Free memory
- `sensors.sensesp.ipaddr` - IP address
- `sensors.sensesp.wifisignal` - WiFi signal strength

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Creating Access Point
- Ensure the device is powered correctly (5V)
- Press and hold the boot button during power-up to force AP mode
- Check serial monitor for error messages

### Cannot Connect to WiFi

- Ensure your WiFi network is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Check that WiFi signal strength is adequate

### Sensors Not Detected
- Verify OneWire sensor connections (VCC, GND, Data)
- Check that 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor is installed on data line
- Maximum recommended wire length is 10 meters

### No Data in Signal K
- Verify Signal K server is running
- Check that access request has been approved
- Ensure correct Signal K paths are configured
- Review device logs for connection errors

### RPM Reading Incorrect
- Calibrate the frequency multiplier in the web configuration
- Verify RPM sensor is triggering correctly
- Check that INPUT_PULLUP is appropriate for your sensor type
